# Daily Planner - DOM Interactive System

## DOM Approach Used
For this project, I used a **Vanilla JavaScript** approach. I focused on `document.createElement` and `appendChild` to build the task list dynamically without using `innerHTML`. This ensures better security and performance as per the lab constraints.

## Challenges Faced
One major challenge was linking the local repository to GitHub via the terminal for the first time. I also had to logic out how to re-update the "Empty State" message whenever a task was deleted from the list.

## Future Feature
If I had backend support, I would implement **User Accounts** so multiple people could save their private planners on this single system.
